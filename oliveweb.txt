since decompiling doesnt work... (the exe uses some "confuser" which did infact confuse me even when i decompiled it)
...i had to use a proxy to monitor requests to the api
after finding an app that fits my needs in an user-friendly manner i recorded a casual oliveweb messenger session with fiddler

first thing i found was that the server host is 68.108.66.195:5000 which was unsurprising (i remember the creator sending me the page to login which was on an ip smth like this)
second thing was that most endpoints used post (except for static data like pfps) and used the classic content-type of "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"

when you want to login and set ur status to online you send requests to these urls with post data in query param format that have fields "username" and "password"
	- http://68.108.66.195:5000/connect/messenger/login.php (use filename instead of username, and data instead of password (requires a ver field too)
	  on success, responds with "Success" in html
	- http://68.108.66.195:5000/connect/messenger/update_solidstatus.php
	  include a "status=Online" field

to confirm if u or someone else is online post to http://68.108.66.195:5000/connect/messenger/get_solidstatus.php with an "username" field that says ur username u want to check.
if online, responds with "Online"

after login, you naturally would want to check ur convos.
this part is the most confusing, but u can try recording http traffic to understand.
im only including stuff i understand anyway, not stuff im baffled abt

post to http://68.108.66.195:5000/connect/messenger/get_messages.php to get conversation ids, which i assume are separated by newline.
you can then use one of these ids to post to http://68.108.66.195:5000/connect/messenger/get_msg.php with field "chatid" set to ur conversation id

this responds with "Loading..." if chatid is blank, or the full chatlog of chat.

normal user-to-user convos and multiuser groups are both considered a chat by the server. to check if a chat is a group, post to http://68.108.66.195:5000/connect/messenger/check_group.php with same "chatid" field, just like in the get_msg.php request.
this responds with a "Yes" or "No"

get the theme of a chat by posting http://68.108.66.195:5000/connect/messenger/get_theme.php with the "chatid".
this returns "Theme" followed by a space and the theme id.

to get a pfp, post to http://68.108.66.195:5000/connect/messenger/get_pfp.php
this returns the url to the pfp which you can then simply request with get.

still unsure how to send msgs, havent tested yet.

now i know how! send a post request to http://68.108.66.195:5000/connect/messenger/update_msg.php with chatid being chatid, "username" and "message" being message content to send.
its that simple.
